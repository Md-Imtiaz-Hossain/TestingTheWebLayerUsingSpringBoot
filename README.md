# Testing The Web Layer Using SpringBoot
<b><u>Software Testing</u></b>  is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.

Some prefer saying Software testing definition as a White Box and Black Box Testing. In simple terms, Software Testing means the Verification of Application Under Test (AUT). This Software Testing course introduces testing software to the audience and justifies the importance of software testing.

* This repo contain different layer of Web Testing of Spring Boot Application. 


### What is Smoke Testing
* In simple terms, smoke tests means verifying the important features are working and there are no showstoppers in the build that is under testing.

Smoke Testing is a software testing process that determines whether the deployed software build is stable or not.
Smoke testing is a confirmation for QA team to proceed with further software testing. It consists of a minimal set of tests run on each build to test software functionalities. Smoke testing is also known as “Build Verification Testing” or “Confidence Testing.”


### Web layer Testing
* A simple test that the application context loads successfully, and continue on to test just the web layer using Spring's MockMvc .


### MockMvc
* MockMvc provides support for Spring MVC testing. It encapsulates all web application beans and makes them available for testing.
